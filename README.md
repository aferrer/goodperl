# Talk: How to identify a good Perl programmer

These are the slides for the presentation "How to identify a good Perl programmer", based on [chromatic's Moder Perl blog post](http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2011/01/how-to-identify-a-good-perl-programmer.html).

The talk was first presented in the beginner level track of the 2016 Barcelona Perl Workshop and will continue to evolve, hopefully with the contribution of other community members.

The talk uses [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
